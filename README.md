## Implementation

It turns out that implementing SEH in safe Rust may not look that straightforward at first glance (as seen in [this post](https://engineering.zeroitlab.com/2022/03/13/rust-seh))

This library uses a different, simpler approach, which is to use a `C` stub that calls back into Rust,
wrapping the call in a `__try __except` block.

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
microseh = { git = "github.com/sonodima/microseh" }
```

> <b>Example:</b> De-referencing a null pointer without crashing the program.

```rust
fn main() {
    microseh::try_catch(|| {
        *std::ptr::null::<i32>();
    })?;
}
```

## Portability

SEH is a Microsoft extension to the C language, so it's only available on Windows with MSVC.
